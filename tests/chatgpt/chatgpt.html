<h2>The Cripplestyle Benches</h2>
<p><strong>by Adrian King</strong></p>

<p>If you travel from Alderholt to Cranborne, just before you reach Cripplestyle, on the left, behind the hedgerow you will just make out a small hill. It has the name King Barrow! It is a popular destination for short walks, with a panoramic view of the surrounding area when you reach the top!</p>

<p>At 324ft King Barrow is the highest hill in the district. The area consists of 23.62 acres of common land (registered units CL 253 and CL 162). The hill itself is not a tumulus but a natural mound...</p>

<p>Between Thursday 28th and Sunday 31st May 2020 a bench was placed on the hill! The seat part was painted red and rested on breeze blocks being secured by a chain mounted on the centre of the seat and buried in the ground below.</p>

<p>By November 2020, the bench had been painted white and fixed to the breeze blocks without the need for the chain. The inscription that had been written on the top was now written on a board secured to the front of the bench. There were now three more poems written on the top of the bench.</p>

<p>Research discovered that it was Martin Hollister, a poet who lived on Cranborne Road between Bittersweet and Sunny Corner...</p>

<p>Martin placed lengths of fallen branches as edging to the path and drained water away from paths. On King Barrow, by January 2021 three more poems had been written and attached to a board on the back of the seat.</p>

<p>By the end of May 2023 all the panels had dropped off and later, some time in June 2023 the bench was removed. Martin, sadly died on 31st December 2022, but we still in pictures have the legacy of what his benches once looked like.</p>

<h3>Sample Poem: Michael</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Michael the Abominable Snowman has got no mate,<br>
In his icy cave he ponders his lonely fate,<br>
He writes his “love wishing” letters to Heart Club columns,<br>
And sits alone all day to plan a hopeful date.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>This was one of the first poems on the King Barrow Bench.</em></p>
